 satavahana_dynasty_reform: "Satavahana Dynasty"
 satavahana_dynasty_reform_desc: "Our ancestral dynasty, which has wielded authority over our kingdom for centuries, bears witness to the ebb and flow of history-from the inception to the demise of the Gupta Empire, the ascendancy of the Karnataka Samrajya, to the establishment of the Deccan Sultanates. Remarkably, even today, an offshoot of this venerable dynasty continues to govern our realm. \nThe time has come for us to reclaim the rich legacy of our lineage and embark on a journey to reconquer our lost territories in both the west and south, thereby revitalizing the grandeur of the Satavahana Empire. Drawing inspiration from the spirits of antiquity, we must initiate comprehensive reforms-strengthening the military, fortifying the state apparatus, and reclaiming what is rightfully ours. The Telugu identity shall experience a renaissance, forging anew the elements that were once lost to time."

 pandya_dynasty_reform: "Pandya Dynasty"
 pandya_dynasty_reform_desc: " Today, we stand as the sole survivor of this illustrious triumvirate, as the Chola and Chera lines have faded into oblivion. As the last remaining Tamil dynasty, it is not merely our duty but our destiny to reclaim our former glory and surpass it, or face our demise. Our aim is to revive our lost kingdom and reinstate our profound influence across the Indian Ocean. \nLegend holds that the Cholas are the heirs of the sun, the Cheras are heroes to the fire, and the Pandyas are heirs to the moon. According to ancient tales, our three dynastic founders were created by Shiva to counter the malevolent Buddhist dynasty of Andhra, the Satavahana, who persecuted and forcibly converted our people. Entrusted with a singular purpose-protecting the children and followers of Shiva-the Kings of Fire exemplify indomitable spirits, the Kings of the Moon emerge as natural leaders of Shiva's devotees, and the Lunar Kings master the realms of the sea, trade, diplomacy, and economy. Our naval and trade prowess is perceived as a divine gift from Shiva himself."
