 karnataka_samrajya_reform: "Karnataka Samrajya"
 karnataka_samrajya_reform_desc: "The Vijayanagar Empire, founded in 1336 by our esteemed leaders Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, stands as a beacon of strength and prosperity in our beloved South India. Our empire's heart, Vijayanagara, pulses with life and grandeur, showcasing magnificent temples and bustling markets that draw traders and scholars from afar. We take immense pride in our military might, which safeguards our lands from northern invaders, and in our vibrant culture, where arts and learning thrive. The patronage of our kings has elevated Hindu traditions, creating a legacy of splendor that resonates through every temple carving and scholarly work. Living in this era, we witness a renaissance of grandeur and unity, with the Vijayanagar Empire as the pinnacle of our civilization's achievements."

 coral_kingdom_reform: "Coral Kingdom"
 coral_kingdom_reform_desc: "As a kingdom situated on an archipelago, we face significant challenges in sourcing construction materials. Beyond palm wood and sand, resources are scarce. However, we are blessed with an abundance of coral reefs. These reefs often form on sandstone, but they are not fully developed sandstone due to the coral growth, resulting in what we call coral stone. This somewhat brittle material is easily and quickly workable, making it an abundant, inexpensive, and essential resource for our construction needs. While it may not match the quality of traditional stone, it is the best option available to us and vital for both our architecture and artistic endeavors."

# Tier 2
 patronage_jain_temples_reform: "Patronage of Jain Temples"
 patronage_jain_temples_reform_desc: "In the vibrant canvas of South Indian commerce, coastal Karnataka traders held sway, with their influence intricately entwined with the sanctity of Jaina basadis-a sacred haven for followers of Jainism. These basadis, standing as symbols of piety and prosperity, were pivotal in the bustling trade hubs of Barkur, Karkala, and Mudabidre. The inscriptions of Hoysala and Vijayanagara eras bear witness to a profound symbiosis between trade and the sacred, where the settis and settikara found both spiritual solace and communal unity within these hallowed bastions. The state's patronage to Jaina basadis, far from mere benevolence, was a strategic alliance aimed at fortifying the sinews of commerce by nurturing the spiritual essence of traders. The basadis, as conduits to the divine, became fulcrums elevating the trade reach of coastal Karnataka-a legacy where prosperity and spiritual fervor intertwined."

 krsi_trivate_reform: "Krsi Tivrate"
 krsi_trivate_reform_desc: "Since water was scarce in the rocky terrain in the Tungabhadra Valley, it had to be harnessed to its optimum use. Therefore, the state tried to control the irrigation techniques in the Vijayanagara metropolitan region and this was also important for the assertion of power and authority. The kings exploited the hydrological environment to its maximum advantage, irrigating agricultural land inside the city, directing water into urban areas for domestic use, and building an impressive system of baths and channels to service the Royal Centre."

 lyand_rutargalalli_vyapara_reform_desc: "The Rayas prioritized internal land trade over ocean trade, striving to foster a vibrant commercial life within the empire. Accounts from foreign travelers, inscriptions, and literature illuminate a network of land routes linking vital cities. Seven highways radiated from the capital: the first to Goa via Bankapur, the second to Sri Rangapattanam via Sivasamudram, the third to Cochin and the Malabar regions, the fourth linking it to Dhanushkoti via Chandragiri, Tirupati, Kanchi, Chidambaram, Madurai, and Rameswaram. The fifth connected to Kondavidu via Udayagiri, the sixth to Raichur and other northern towns. Beyond these, cities were linked to key towns in the empire, fostering trade, commerce, and safeguarding merchants along these routes."
 sagarottara_vyapara_reform: "Sagarotta Vyapara"
 sagarottara_vyapara_reform_desc: "The western sea ports were categorized into three groups: Konkan group, Tulunadu group, and Malabar group. The Konkan group included ports like Mirjan, Honovar, Bhatkal, Basrur, Bakanur, Mangalore, and Kumbola. Meanwhile, the Malabar group comprised as many as 25 ports extending between Mount Delhi in the North and Kanniyaakumaari in the South, with key seaports like Cannanore, Dharmapattanam, Calicut, Cochin, and Quilon. On the eastern coast, ports were divided into the Coromandel group and Telingana group. The Coromandel group featured ports such as Nagapatnam, Tirupamalai, Raja Patnam, Tharangambadi, Parangipettai, Devanam Patnam, Mailapur, and Pulicat. In contrast, the Telingana group included only two ports: Motupalli and Masuli Patnam. These ports played a vital role in facilitating trade and commerce during this period, engaging in exchanges with Persian, Arabian, Southeast Asian countries, the Maldives, Ceylon, and Pegu. The import and export activities encompassed a wide array of goods required by the populace."

 GE_Deccan_Reforms_Events.1.T: "Land Revenue"
 GE_Deccan_Reforms_Events.1.D: "In the administrative framework of the Vijayanagara Empire, the territory was intricately divided into six distinct provinces, each under the jurisdiction of local administrators. These officials were tasked with the crucial responsibility of overseeing the collection of land revenue, which served as the lifeblood of the government's finances. To ensure a systematic approach to taxation, the land revenue department meticulously classified the vast expanse of land into three primary categories: wetland, dryland, and woodland. This classification facilitated a more nuanced understanding of the varied agricultural and geographical features across the empire, enabling fair and efficient taxation practices. \nBeyond the land tax, the government implemented a range of supplementary levies to bolster its revenue streams. These included taxes on grazing, marriages, customs duties, and activities such as gardening and manufacturing. Despite the relatively high taxation rates, the administration prided itself on maintaining a fair and equitable system. Taxpayers were afforded the flexibility to discharge their obligations through either monetary payments or in kind, reflecting the diverse economic landscape of the empire. This multifaceted approach to taxation not only sustained the financial stability of the government but also fostered a sense of economic cohesion and cooperation among its subjects."

 estate_persian_weaving_industry: "Persian Weaving Industry"
 estate_persian_weaving_industry_desc: "An ancient form of Deccani art, introduced by Persian colonists during the Delhi Sultanate era, revolves around the craftsmanship of tapestries. This art form found particular favor among our nobility, with a penchant for the more extravagant creations. The Deccani carpet, adorned with gold, silver, precious gems, and the exquisite lapis lazuli, epitomized opulence. Unfortunately, this artistic legacy has all but vanished in the wake of the Bahmani Sultanate's fall, exacerbated by the reluctance of traders to venture deep into the unstable regions, raising the costs of goods. Now more than ever, these workshops depend on royal patronage to sustain this ancient and extravagant tradition."
