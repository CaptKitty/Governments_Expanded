 mantua_mecenatismo_mantovano_reform_desc: "The Gonzagas supported and sponsored numerous artists in order to give prestige to their family; they were important collectors of works of art, second only to the popes and the Medici. The paintings and objects were mainly exhibited in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua, configuring itself as a real museum within the museum. \nFerdinando Gonzaga, returning from Rome in 1612 on the occasion of his appointment as sixth Duke of Mantua, found in the palaces very rich artistic endowments, which required a work of cataloging. He personally took care of the reorganization, cataloging and placement of art objects. The family could boast the most important museum in Europe, with 20,000 precious objects and 1,800 paintings by the most prestigious artists."
