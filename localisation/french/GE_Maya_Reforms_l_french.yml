 sajtaj_u_yajawil_k_oxelil_u_k_iche_reform_desc: "With a heritage stretching back millennia, our people have safeguarded the southern realms of Mesoamerica, driven by a mission to disseminate Maya culture's values and traditions. In the northern expanses, their efforts at colonization bore fruit, as they shared expertise in agriculture, architecture, and spirituality with neighboring societies. Yet, these strides were tainted by external forces like the Aztecs, who sought to exploit Maya teachings for their gain. These encounters taught valuable lessons about cultural preservation and the sanctity of faith, society, and architecture. Rather than repeat past errors, our people approach southern expansion with prudence and foresight, mindful of the complexities ahead. They march into uncharted territories, steadfast in their quest to spread enlightenment, thus honoring their ancestors' legacy and illuminating the path for a future where enlightenment reigns supreme."

Guided by the sagacity of the priests, literacy became a sacred obligation, a pathway towards enlightenment and comprehension. In a realm where myths and legends echoed through every stone and shadow, the ability to read and write in our native tongue was both an honor and a duty. Under the guidance of the priesthood, schools and academies flourished, their halls vibrant with the flickering light of knowledge. From the lowliest farmer to the most esteemed warrior, all were urged to grasp the quill and parchment, to explore the depths of written wisdom and unlock the secrets of bygone eras. Championing literacy was not merely a matter of practicality for the priesthood; it was a means of preserving our cultural heritage, safeguarding our sacred texts. Foremost among these was the Popol Vuh, a repository of ancient wisdom and myth that resonated deeply with our people's essence. Thus, armed with pen and fueled by curiosity, they delved into its pages, seeking solace and inspiration within its timeless truths.

With deft hands and sharp minds, they ushered in an era of innovation, crafting weapons and tools far superior to their ancestors' stone and obsidian implements. From their molten furnaces emerged an impressive array of weaponry and equipment, each a testament to their skill and artistry.
